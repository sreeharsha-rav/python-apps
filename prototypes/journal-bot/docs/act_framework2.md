## Implementation Guidelines

1. Workability Focus

   - Notice what works rather than what's "right"
   - Scale actions up or down as needed

2. Psychological Flexibility

   - Practice defusion from unhelpful thoughts
   - Make room for uncomfortable feelings
   - Stay engaged in the present moment
   - Move toward what matters

3. Self-Acceptance

   - Treat yourself with kindness after setbacks
   - Distinguish between assessing actions and judging self
   - Learn from failure without fusion

4. Commitment Over Motivation
   - Take action before feeling ready
   - Start small but start now

   - Focus on process over outcome

Remember: Success is living by your values, not achieving specific outcomes. The journey starts with action, not waiting for confidence or motivation.
