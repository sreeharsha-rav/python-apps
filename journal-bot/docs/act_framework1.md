# ACT Action Journal Framework

## Core ACT Principles

1. Values-Guided Action - What matters most guides what we do
2. Present Moment Awareness - Engaging fully with the now
3. Psychological Flexibility - Adapting responses to serve our values
4. Defusion - Seeing thoughts as thoughts, not absolute truths

## Daily Practice Structure

### Present Moment Check-in

Complete one action-focused prompt:

- "Right now, I am taking action by..."
- "In this moment, I am moving toward..."
- "My body is currently..."

### Action Modules

Choose modules based on your current situation:

**Values in Action Module**

- What value-aligned actions did I take today?
- Which opportunities to live my values did I notice?
- What actions, even tiny ones, expressed what matters to me?
- What value would I like to embody through action tomorrow?

**Barriers & Workability Module**

- What actions worked well today?
- What actions didn't produce the results I wanted?
- What different actions could I try next time?
- What support or resources would help me take action?

**Committed Action Planning**

- What specific action will I take tomorrow toward my values?
- When and where will I take this action?
- What might get in the way, and how will I handle it?
- What's the smallest possible step I could take?

**Willingness & Action Module**

- What uncomfortable experiences did I make room for to take action?
- How did I stay in motion even with difficult thoughts/feelings?
- What actions showed courage or persistence?
- What new behaviors am I willing to try?

**Mindful Action Module**

- What actions did I take with full attention today?
- How did I engage fully in what I was doing?
- When did I notice myself on autopilot?
- What helped me stay present in my actions?

### Daily Integration

End with an action-focused closing:

- "The most workable action I took today was..."
- "Tomorrow I commit to..."
- "One small step I'm ready to take is..."

## Weekly Action Review

Take time to review your actions:

1. Action Patterns

   - Which actions moved me toward my values?
   - What patterns of avoidance did I notice?
   - Which actions were most workable?

2. Progress Recognition

   - What new actions did I try?
   - How did I handle barriers differently?
   - What small steps accumulated into progress?

3. Action Planning
   - What values need more active expression?
   - Which actions could I experiment with?
   - What support would help me take action?

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Focus on Behavior

   - Emphasize what you DO rather than what you think/feel
   - Notice actions, no matter how small
   - Track concrete steps, not just intentions

2. Workability Lens

   - Ask "Did this action bring me closer to my values?"
   - Notice what works rather than what's "right"
   - Experiment with different actions

3. Flexible Persistence

   - Return to action after getting stuck
   - Modify actions rather than abandoning them
   - Scale actions up or down as needed

4. Integration Practices
   - Review actions weekly
   - Notice patterns of effective action
   - Build on what works

Remember: The goal is not perfect action but persistent movement toward what matters.
